                        Gagandeep Singh, better known as Deep Kalsi, is an Indian singer, music producer, and songwriter based in New Delhi. His musical journey began early, dropping out of college to pursue his passion for music. As a member of the Kalamkaar label, he's collaborated with major music labels like Zee Music, ALTBalaji, and Sony Music India.
                        
                        In 2010, Deep founded the D-Freakers crew, releasing successful singles and even opening for Bohemia. Despite eventual dissolution, Deep's dedication to music never wavered. He honed his skills at the Beat Factory Academy in 2014 and delved into music production with his father's support.
                        
                        A stint in Mumbai exposed him to the hip-hop scene, though cultural differences led to personal struggles. With the encouragement of friends and family, Deep persevered, eventually establishing his home studio. Dreams and Hustle (DNH) signed him in 2017, where he collaborated with artists like KR$NA and Karma.
                        
                        Joining Kalamkaar under Raftaar's mentorship provided a platform for Deep's artistic vision. Collaborations like "Jean Teri" with Raftaar and Jaz Dhami showcased his talent. Deep's versatility shone as he wrote and produced the title track for Alt Balaji's "Who's Your Daddy" in 2020.
                        
                        Through highs and lows, Deep Kalsi remained resilient, viewing music as his ultimate form of self-expression. His transformation from Gagandeep Singh to Deep Kalsi embodies the evolution of an artist dedicated to his craft.</p>
