                    <p>Yunan, a young hip-hop artist based in New Delhi, has journeyed through various stages to gain recognition as a singer. Notable for tracks like 'Netflix And Chill' featuring Raftaar, 'Kyu,' 'You,' and his latest single 'Slay,' Yunan's music blends commercial dance with Spanish vibes.

                        Inspired by the idea of 'couples who slay together,' Yunan crafted 'Slay' spontaneously in the studio. His career began with dance, appearing on 'Dance India Dance Lil' Masters' in 2012 and briefly acting in MTV Splitsvilla Season 12. Grateful for platforms like Kalamkaar and Sony Music India, Yunan acknowledges the challenges of standing out in a saturated music market.
                        
                        Guided by popular rapper Raftaar since age 16, Yunan considers him both a mentor and a friend. Raftaar featured Yunan on tracks like 'Sick,' 'Beshaq,' and 'Mundiya Di Mautt,' shaping Yunan's artistic journey significantly.
                        
                        Yunan credits Raftaar for nurturing his talent and kickstarting his music career. The young artist aspires to emulate Justin Bieber's success in the Hindi pop genre, aiming to become the Hindi pop equivalent of the global sensation.
                        
                        Currently, Yunan is busy collaborating with other artists and working on his original tracks. He plans to release his debut EP followed by an album, promising experimentation and innovation in his upcoming showcases.
                        
                        Yunan's journey underscores the importance of mentorship and perseverance in the competitive music industry. With Raftaar's guidance and his own dedication, Yunan is poised to make his mark in the Indian music scene, aspiring to reach the heights of his idols while staying true to his unique style and vision.</p>
